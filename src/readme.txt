coursework feedback:
for an assignment that tries to teach us the supposed way of doing OOP, I find it annoying that I had to use very awkward workarounds
there is little to no freedom in the implementation, as I realised from how strict the test harness is (e.g. preserve insertion order of the arraylist facilities etc)
with that siad, I did enjoy doing this assignment. I like the coursework from last year (orchestra) much better than this year's.
